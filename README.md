# CPNT 262 Assignment 2 Nuxt Landing Page

## Thoughts on Project

- I really sunk a lot of time into this assignment. The fun of making it all work really took a hold of me! I just couldn't stop lol but it was a learning experience on how to use grid, flex, and nuxt3 in greater depth. This will definitely help going forward for the group and final project!

## Struggles

- I struggled with adding some breakpoints to the cards to make them more responsive. I will investigate further in future projects

### March 25th Plan:

1. Create a boilerplate nuxt3 project
2. install npm
3. add modules to `nuxt.config.ts`
4. install modules such as tailwind
5. git init this repo

### Plan for Following Days:

1. Using this [website](https://www.awwwards.com/) I will find a layout that I like and try to make a landing page based off that.
2. I liked this website [rajacademy](https://rajacademy.com/). A lot of the designs on awwwards are amazing, but much to complex for what I can accomplish at this point. The design seems fairly straight forward for me to work through.
3. For the design, i'll need:

- A header with a logo and links
- I'll also need a hero section that encompasses the whole page with a utility button.
- Below the header i'll need a large section for a text
- And lastly below that i'll add a couple of cards that awe similar to the card below the massive text

5. Next ill create some re-usable components such as the button and cards utilities
6. Create the necessary components to design the header, hero, cards, and footer.
7. Lastly, read you [gist](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/59068feba277c73cc2a4be7a15ec6f59) so that name the components correctly
8. Once I have a boilerplate design, ill deploy this repo on `netlify`
